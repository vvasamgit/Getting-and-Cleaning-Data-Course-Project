# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Readme file



The purpose of this project is to collect and clean "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set. After cleaning source data set the final tidy data set will be created with averages of all (mean and standard deviation) variables of each activity and subject (group by activity name and subject id).  This project creates the following files:

1) run_analysis.R  
    Reads source data files and produces tidyHARDataSetAvg.txt file
2) README.md (this file)
3) CodeBook.md
  Describes the variables, the data, and the transformations used for producing final tidy data set
